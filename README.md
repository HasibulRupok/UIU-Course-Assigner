# UIU-Course-Assigner

The `"Course Assigner"` is a web application designed to simplify and automate the process of creating course routines for a university or educational institution. The application requires two CSV files as input: one containing a list of courses and another containing a list of faculty members.

With the "Course Assigner," users can initiate a new semester and begin creating a routine for assigning courses to faculty members. The interface allows for a user-friendly `drag-and-drop` functionality, enabling users to assign courses to specific faculty members, time slots, and sections.

The system incorporates intelligent `conflict detection`, which promptly alerts users if there are any conflicts related to time or section assignments. This feature ensures that the routine remains `error-free` and helps users rectify any conflicts easily.

Once the routine is finalized, users have the option to save it to a database for future reference. Additionally, they can export the routine as an Excel file, mimicking the manual process typically performed by university authorities. By automating this tedious and time-consuming task, the "Course Assigner" saves significant effort and resources.

Moreover, the application offers a search functionality that allows users to retrieve information about previous course routines. If users upload previous course routine data, they can search for specific courses and find details about the faculty members who taught those courses in previous semesters.

In summary, the "Course Assigner" streamlines the process of creating course routines by providing a `user-friendly interface`, `automated conflict detection`, `database storage`, and `Excel export` capabilities. It eliminates manual effort, reduces the chances of errors, and offers efficient retrieval of historical course assignment information.
